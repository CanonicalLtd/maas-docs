Title: Local Image Mirror


# Local Image Mirror

Images are delivered to MAAS via the SimpleStreams protocol and the mirroring
of these images is worthy of consideration. This option is especially useful
when your environment has a slow or unreliable internet link. In such cases,
when the images are requested they will be instantly available and the
disadvantaged link will be less readily apparent.

Begin by installing the necessary software on the host that will house the
mirror:

```bash
sudo apt install simplestreams
```

First define some variables to unclutter eventual CLI commands:

```bash
KEYRING_FILE=/usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-cloudimage-keyring.gpg
IMAGE_SRC=https://images.maas.io/ephemeral-v2/daily/
IMAGE_DIR=/var/www/html/maas/images/ephemeral-v2/daily
```

!!! Note:
    If you wish to use older images (which change far less frequently,
    but which will lack security updates), you can use the 'releases' stream.
    Simply replace the word 'daily' with 'releases' in two of the above variables.

The below example is a good choice for the year 2016. It selects all available
kernels that are compatible with either Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) and Ubuntu 16.04
(Xenial) for the amd64 architecture, representing a download of approximately
2.3 GB:

```bash
sudo sstream-mirror --keyring=$KEYRING_FILE $IMAGE_SRC $IMAGE_DIR \
	'arch=amd64' 'release~(trusty|xenial)' --max=1 --progress
```

To know in advance what the `sstream-mirror` command will grab and/or if you
want to save bandwidth and time due to possible mis-selections, include the
`--dry-run` option. When you are satisfied, remove that option to initiate the
download.

The images will be written to disk in the directory defined by the variable
'IMAGE_DIR' above and the 'location' of the new boot source will be:

`URL=http://<myserver>/maas/images/ephemeral-v2/daily/`

Where `<myserver>` identifies your server's hostname or IP address.

Verify the availability of the images by visiting the above URL.

The final `sstream-mirror` command should be invoked at regular intervals (i.e.
with `cron`) to ensure the mirror contains the latest images.


## Configure MAAS to use the local mirror

To point MAAS to the local image server (mirror) using the web UI navigate to
the Settings tab and scroll down to the 'Boot Images' section. Then fill in the
fields 'Sync URL' and 'Keyring Path' using the values, respectively, for
variables 'URL' and 'KEYRING_FILE' from above.

See [CLI Image Management][cli-add-an-image-source] for instructions on how to
do this with the CLI.
