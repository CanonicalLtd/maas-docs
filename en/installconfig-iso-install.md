# Install from ISO

The [Ubuntu Server ISO][download-server-iso] offers to have the
server-to-be-installed provide a complete MAAS environment or a single rack
controller. This page is based on Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS.

![server install menu][img__iso-install-1604-01]

Choosing option **Install MAAS Region Controller** will actually install an
entire MAAS environment. That is, it is equivalent to installing the 'maas'
metapackage. The wording of this menu option will change in a future printing
of the ISO.

Choosing option **Install MAAS Rack Controller** will install a rack
controller and register it with an existing region controller. Therefore,
*an existing region controller is a requirement* for this option to succeed.

> â“˜ Using the ISO to install a rack controller is typically used to install an extra rack controller since the recommended starting design is to co-locate the rack controller with the region controller.

Each of these two options will add extra dialog boxes to the generic Ubuntu
Server install procedure. This page covers these extra dialogs only. See the
[Ubuntu Server Guide][ubuntu-server-guide] for details on installing Ubuntu
Server.


## Region controller

After having chosen to install a region controller, three consecutive dialog
boxes will appear in order to do the following:

- Install a MAAS environment
- Set a username for the MAAS administrator
- Set a password for the MAAS administrator

^# Walkthrough of MAAS environment installation

  Confirm the installation of a MAAS environment.
  ![regiond install dialog 1][img__iso-install-regiond-01]
  
  Provide the name of the initial MAAS administrator. It can be anything but in
  this example 'admin' was chosen. This account is distinct from the system
  account that will be created later as part of the generic Ubuntu Server
  install.
  ![regiond install dialog 2][img__iso-install-regiond-02]
  
  Complete the creation of the MAAS administrator account by supplying a
  password.
  ![regiond install dialog 3][img__iso-install-regiond-03]

During one step of the generic Server install you will be asked whether a proxy
is needed for the server itself. This is separate from the proxy that
MAAS provides to its nodes (see [Proxy][proxy]).


## Rack controller

After having chosen to install a rack controller, three consecutive dialog
boxes will appear in order to do the following:

- Install a rack controller
- Input the location (URL) of the region API server
- Input the shared secret required for rack controller registration

For nodes on an [IPv6][ipv6] subnet, the URL must use a hostname instead of an
IP address and it must resolve to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, both on the
rack controller and on the nodes.

^# Walkthrough of rack controller installation

  Confirm the installation of a rack controller.
  ![rackd install dialog 1][img__iso-install-rackd-01]

  Point the new rack controller at an existing region API server so it can
  register with it.
  ![rackd install dialog 2][img__iso-install-rackd-02]

  Provide the secret required for registering the rack controller. It is found
  on the region API server.
  ![rackd install dialog 3][img__iso-install-rackd-03]

The final dialog will not confirm whether registration was successful. Once
Ubuntu Server is fully installed and rebooted you should inspect
`/var/log/maas/rackd.log` for any possible error messages. Alternatively, you
may verify that the rack controller shows up in the web UI. You can always
register the rack controller manually (after the server has rebooted) if a
mistake was made. See [MAAS CLI - install a rack controller][cli-install-rackd].

You can choose to display the typed secret (necessary for registering the rack
controller) in cleartext. This can help prevent mis-typing and thus avoiding a
failed registration.

An SSH server is not installed on the rack controller by default. Near the end
of the generic Server install there will be the opportunity to install optional
software. You may install an SSH server at this time.


## Next steps

Once you have installed your MAAS environment (region + rack controller) and
any possible extra rack controllers(s), see the [Checklist][checklist] for what
to do next.
