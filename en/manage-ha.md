# High Availability

This page will describe how to provide high availability (HA) for MAAS at both
the rack controller level and the region controller level. See
[Concepts and terms][concepts-controllers] for detailed information on what
services are provided by each of those levels.


## Rack controller HA

Although DHCP is handled at the rack controller level one should not worry
about a second MAAS-managed DHCP service coming online and causing disruption.
DHCP software is added intelligently when a new rack controller is installed
and DHCP HA will become available as an option.

Install a second rack controller by reading [Rack controller][install-rackd].

### BMC HA

HA for BMC control (node power cycling) is provided out of the box once a
second rack controller is present. MAAS will automatically identify which rack
controller is responsible for a BMC and communication will be set up
accordingly.

### DHCP HA

DHCP HA affects node management (enlistment, commissioning and deployment). It
enables a primary and a secondary DHCP instance to serve the same VLAN where
all lease information is replicated between rack controllers. DHCP needs to be
MAAS-managed in order for DHCP HA to work.

If DHCP is being enabled for the first time after a second rack controller is
added then enable it according to [Enabling DHCP][enabling-dhcp].

However, if the initial rack controller already has DHCP enabled then a
reconfiguration of DHCP is in order. Simply access the VLAN in question (via
the 'Subnets' page) and choose action 'Reconfigure DHCP'. There you will see
the second rack controller appearing in the 'Secondary controller' field. All
you should have to do is press the 'Reconfigure DHCP' button:

![reconfigure DHCP][img__reconfigure-dhcp]

The setup of rack controller HA is now complete.

!!! Note:
    For HA purposes, DHCP provisioning will take into account multiple DNS
    services when there is more than one region controller on a single region.    


## Region controller HA

Implementing region controller HA involves setting up:

- PostgreSQL HA
- Secondary API server(s)
- Virtual IP address

Load balancing is optional.

### PostgreSQL HA

MAAS stores all state information in the PostgreSQL database. It is therefore
recommended to run it in HA mode. Configuring HA for PostgreSQL is external to
MAAS. You will therefore need to study the
[PostgreSQL documentation][upstream-postgresql-docs] and implement the variant
of HA that you feel most comfortable with.

A quick treatment of [PostgreSQL HA: hot standby][postgresql-ha] is provided
here for convenience only. Its purpose is to give an idea of what's involved at
the command line level when implementing one particular form of HA with
PostgreSQL.

!!! Note:
    Each region controller uses up to 40 connections to PostgreSQL in high load
    situations. Running 2 region controllers requires no modifications to the
    `max_connections` in `postgresql.conf`. More than 2 region controllers
    requires that `max_connections` be adjusted to add 40 more connections per
    extra region controller added to the HA configuration.

### Secondary API server

This section assumes that PostgreSQL HA has been set up.

!!! Note:
    Any number of API servers can be present as long as each connects to
    the same PostgreSQL database and allows the required number of connections.

On the primary database host, edit file `/etc/postgresql/9.5/main/pg_hba.conf`
to allow the eventual secondary API server to contact the primary PostgreSQL
database. Include the below line, replacing $SECONDARY_API_SERVER_IP with the
IP address of the host that will contain the secondary API server:

```no-highlight
host    maasdb          maas	$SECONDARY_API_SERVER_IP/32         md5
```

!!! Note:
    It is very common for the primary database server and the primary API
    server to reside on the same host.

Apply this change by restarting the database:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```

On a secondary host, add the new API server by installing `maas-region-api`:

```bash
sudo apt install maas-region-api
```

The `/etc/maas/regiond.conf` file from the primary API server will be needed.
Below, we assume it can be copied (scp) from the 'ubuntu' account home
directory using password authentication (adjust otherwise). The
`local_config_set` command will edit that file by pointing to the host that
contains the primary PostgreSQL database. DNS (`bind9`) configuration options
are also rationalized between bind9 itself and the same options within MAAS:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop maas-regiond
sudo scp ubuntu@$PRIMARY_API_SERVER:regiond.conf /etc/maas/regiond.conf
sudo chown root:maas /etc/maas/regiond.conf
sudo chmod 640 /etc/maas/regiond.conf
sudo maas-region local_config_set --database-host $PRIMARY_PG_SERVER
sudo systemctl restart bind9
sudo systemctl start maas-regiond
```

Check the log files for any errors:

- `/var/log/maas/regiond.log`
- `/var/log/maas/maas.log`
- `/var/log/syslog`

### Load balancing (optional)

Load balancing can be added with the [HAProxy][upstream-haproxy] load
balancer software.

On each API server host, before `haproxy` is installed, `apache2` needs to be
stopped (and disabled). This is because both apache2 and haproxy listen on the
same port (TCP 80). Recall that Apache is only used to redirect port 80 to port
5240.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop apache2
sudo systemctl disable apache2
sudo apt install haproxy
```

Configure each API server's load balancer by copying the following into
`/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` (see the
[upstream configuration manual][upstream-haproxy-manual]
as a reference). Replace $PRIMARY_API_SERVER_IP and $SECONDARY_API_SERVER_IP
with their respective IP addresses:

```yaml
frontend maas
    bind    *:80
    retries 3
    option  redispatch
    option  http-server-close
    default_backend maas

backend maas
    timeout server 90s
    balance source
    hash-type consistent
    server localhost localhost:5240 check
    server maas-api-1 $PRIMARY_API_SERVER_IP:5240 check
    server maas-api-2 $SECONDARY_API_SERVER_IP:5240 check
```

Where `maas-api-1` and `maas-api-2` are arbitrary server labels.

Now restart the load balancer to have these changes take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart haproxy
```

### Virtual IP

A *virtual IP* (VIP) will be used as the effective IP address of all region API
servers. This will be done with the aid of the
[Keepalived][upstream-keepalived] routing software.

On each API server host, install the software, load a kernel module, set it to
load upon reboot and pass a kernel option:

```bash
sudo apt install keepalived
sudo modprobe ip_vs
echo 'ip_vs' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
echo 'net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind=1' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/60-keepalived-nonlocal.conf
sudo systemctl restart procps
```

Create the file `/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf` (see the
[keepalived.conf man page][keepalived-man-page] as a reference) based on the
example below. Either `apache2` or `haproxy` will be referred to, depending on
whether load balancing (haproxy) was implemented or not (see previous section).

The following variables are used:

- INTERFACE: The network interface (e.g. eth0) from which the API server can be
  reached by MAAS clients.
- PASSWORD: Participating servers authenticate with one another using this
  chosen password in order to synchronize. This example uses a cleartext
  password (auth_type PASS).
- VIP: The virtual IP. This is any IP address available on the subnet.
- PRIORITY: An integer (1-255) that indicates a preference for the
  corresponding API server to claim the VIP. A larger value indicates a greater
  preference. For example, the preferred primary could have 150 while the
  preferred secondary could have 100.

Their values are represented when they are preceded with the '$' character
(e.g. $VIP). These are to be replaced with actual values in the file.

```no-highlight
### Un-comment next 4 lines if using haproxy
#vrrp_script chk_haproxy {
#    script "killall -0 haproxy"
#    interval 2
#}

### Un-comment next 4 lines if using apache2
#vrrp_script chk_apache2 {
#    script "killall -0 apache2"
#    interval 2
#}

vrrp_script chk_named {
    script "killall -0 named"
    interval 2
}

vrrp_instance maas_region {
    state MASTER
    interface $INTERFACE
    priority $PRIORITY
    virtual_router_id 51
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass $PASSWORD
    }
    track_script {
        ### Un-comment next line if using haproxy
        #chk_haproxy
        ### Un-comment next line if using apache2
        #chk_apache2
        chk_named
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        $VIP
    }
}
```

Restart the daemon to have these changes take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart keepalived
```

!!! Note:
    If this is being done inside a container, its host needs the ip\_vs
    module loaded and the sysctl change. A restart of the container will then be
    required.

Finally, for all API servers, replace the original IP address in the MAAS URL
with that of the VIP. Then inform all rack controllers of that change.

To adjust an API server:

```bash
sudo maas-region local_config_set --maas-url http://$VIP/MAAS
sudo systemctl restart maas-regiond
```

To adjust a rack controller:

```bash
sudo maas-rack config --region-url http://$VIP/MAAS
sudo systemctl restart maas-rackd
```

The configuration of region controller HA is now complete.

**The API server(s) must be now be referenced (e.g. web UI, MAAS CLI) using
port 80 (as opposed to port 5240).**
