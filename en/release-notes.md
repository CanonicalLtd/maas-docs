# Release Notes 2.4

MAAS 2.4 is currently under development. The current release is 
[MAAS 2.4.0 (alpha2)][currentrelease]. See 
[Historical release notes][historical-release-notes] for release notes for
stable versions.

The development version of MAAS is available from the *proposed* repository of
the upcoming Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) release and the MAAS Next PPA
repository.

To install from the MAAS Next PPA (ppa:maas/next) repository:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository -yu ppa:maas/next
sudo apt install maas
```

### MAAS Client Library (python-libmaas)

The official Python client library for MAAS is available in the Ubuntu 18.04
LTS package archive or you can download the source from:
[https://github.com/maas/python-libmaas/releases](https://github.com/maas/python-libmaas/releases)

## 2.4.0 (alpha2)

### NTP services provided by Chrony

Starting with 2.4.0 alpha 2, and in common with changes made to Ubuntu Server,
‘ntpd’ has been replaced with [Chrony][chrony] for the NTP protocol.

MAAS will handle the upgrade process automatically and resume NTP service operation.

### Vanilla CSS Framework Transition

MAAS 2.4.0 is transitioning to a new version of the
[Vanilla CSS framework][vanilla], which will bring a fresher look to the MAAS
web UI. This transition is currently *work-in-progress* and not all of the UI
have been fully updated. As a result, expect to see some inconsistencies in new
release.

### New Features & Improvements

#### NTP services provided by Chrony

Starting with 2.4.0 alpha 2, and in common with changes made to Ubuntu Server,
MAAS replaces ‘ntpd’ with [chrony][chrony] for the NTP protocol. MAAS will
continue to provide services exactly the same way and users will not be
affected by the change. The upgrade process is handled transparently.

This means that:

- MAAS will configure chrony as peers on all Region Controllers
- MAAS will configure chrony as a client of peers for all Rack Controllers
- Machines will use Rack Controllers as they do today

#### MAAS internals optimisation

MAAS 2.4 is currently undergoing major surgery to improve various areas of
operation that are not visible to the user. These updates will improve the
overall performance of MAAS in larger environments.

These improvements include:

**AsyncIO based event loop**

MAAS has an event loop which performs various internal actions. In older
versions of MAAS, the event loop was managed by the default *Twisted* event
loop. MAAS now uses an AsyncIO based event loop, driven by uvloop, which is
targeted at improving internal performance.

**Improved daemon management**

MAAS has changed the way daemons are run to allow users to see both ‘regiond’
and ‘rackd’ as processes in the process list.

As part of these changes, regiond workers are now managed by a master regiond
process. In older versions of MAAS, each worker was directly run by systemd. The
master process is now in charge of ensuring workers are running at all times,
re-spawning new workers in case of failures. This also allows users to see the
worker hierarchy in the process list.

**Ability to increase the number of regiond workers**

Following the improved way MAAS daemons are run, further internal changes have
been made to allow the number of regiond workers to be increased automatically.
This allows MAAS to scale to handle an increased number of internal operations
in larger environments.

While this capability is already available, it is not yet available by default.
It will become available in the following milestone release.

**Database query optimisation**

Internal improvements have been made to reduce the footprint and number of
database queries. Some areas that have been addressed in this release include:

- When saving node objects (e.g. making any update of a machine, device, rack
  controller, etc), MAAS validated changes across various fields. This
  required an increased number of queries for fields, even when they were not
  being updated. MAAS now tracks specific fields that change and only performs
  queries for those fields.  For example, to update a power state, MAAS would
  perform 11 queries. After these improvements, only 1 query is now performed.

- On every transaction, MAAS performed 2 queries to update the timestamp. This
  has now been consolidated into a single query per transaction.

These changes greatly improves MAAS performance and database utilisation in
larger environments. More improvements will continue to be made as we continue
to examine various areas in MAAS.

#### UI optimisation

MAAS is being optimised to reduce the amount of data loaded in the WebSocket
API to render the UI. This is targeted at only processing data for viewable
information, improving various legacy areas. Currently, the work done in this
area includes:

- Script results are only loaded for viewable nodes in the machine listing
  page, reducing the overall amount of data loaded.
- The node object is updated in the WebSocket only when something has changed
  in the database, reducing the data transferred to the clients as well as the
  amount of internal queries.

#### Audit logging

Continuing with the audit logging improvements, *alpha2* now adds audit logging
for all user actions that affect Hardware Testing & Commissioning.

### Issues fixed in this release

## 2.4.0 (alpha1)

### Dependency on tgt (iSCSI) has been dropped

MAAS 2.3 moved away from using iSCSI to run ephemeral environments and
deployments, adding the ability to perform the same functions with a *squashfs*
image. While this removed the requirement for *tgt*, the dependency wasn't
dropped from 2.3. As of 2.4, however, tgt has been completely removed.

### Apache2 dependency dropped from Debian packages

MAAS 2.0 changed the web UI to port 5240 and deprecated the use of port 80.
However, so as to not break deployments when upgrading from the previous LTS
release, MAAS continued to have *apache2* as a dependency. This was purely to
provide a reverse proxy to allow users to connect via port 80.

The availability of the MAAS *snap* changes that behaviour, longer providing
web UI access on port 80. To remain consistent with the snap, the Debian
package removes its dependency on *apache2* and drops proxy access via port 80.

### Python libmaas (0.6.0) available in the Ubuntu Archive

The new [MAAS Client
Library](#maas-client-library-(python-libmaas)) is now available in the Ubuntu
Archives for Ubuntu 18.04. *Libmaas* is an asyncio-based client library that
provides an improved programming interface to interact with MAAS. More details
below.

### New Features & Improvements

#### Machine Locking

MAAS adds the ability to lock machines, preventing the user from
performing actions that could change their state. This gives MAAS a prevention
mechanism for potentially catastrophic actions. For example, it prevents
powering off machines by mistake, or releasing machines that could bring
workloads down.

#### Audit logging

With the introduction of *audit logging*, MAAS 2.4 allows the administrators to
audit the user’s actions.

The audit logs are available to administrators via the MAAS CLI/API, giving
administrators a centralised location to access these logs. See
[Audit Event Logs][audit-logs] for more details.

#### Commissioning Harness

**Support for firmware upgrades and hardware specific scripts**

The *commissioning harness* has been expanded with various improvements to help
administrators write their own firmware upgrades and hardware specific scripts.
These improvements addresses some of the challenges administrators face when
performing such tasks at scale. 

Improvements include:

- auto-select all firmware upgrade/storage hardware changes (API
  only, UI will be available soon)
- write and run scripts for specific hardware
- reboot machines from the commissioning environment without disrupting the commissioning process

These improvements allow administrators to:

- target specific hardware specific by specifying PCI ID, modalias, vendor or
  model of the machine or device
- use script metadata to create firmware upgrade scripts that require a reboot
  before the machine finishes the commissioning process
- define where a script can obtain proprietary firmware and/or proprietary
  tools to perform any operations required.

See [Commissioning and Hardware Testing Scripts][hardware-scripts] for more details.

#### Minor improvements

**Gather information about BIOS & firmware**

MAAS now probes for more underlying system details, including the model, serial
number, BIOS and firmware of a machine (where available). It also gathers
details on storage devices and network interfaces.

### MAAS Client Library (python-libmaas)

**New upstream release - 0.6.0**

A new release is now available in the Ubuntu Archive for Bionic. The new
release lets you do the following:

- add/read/update/delete storage devices attached to machines
- configure partitions and mount points
- configure bcache
- configure RAID
- configure LVM

### Known issues

[LP: #1748712][bug] - 2.4.0a1 upgrade failed with old node event data

It has been reported that an upgrade to MAAS 2.4.0(alpha1) failed due to the
existence of old data from a non-existent node stored in the database. This
could have been due to an older development version of MAAS which could have
left an entry in the node event table. A work around is provided in the bug
report.

If you hit this issue, please update the bug report immediately so MAAS
developers can get a better idea of the problem.
