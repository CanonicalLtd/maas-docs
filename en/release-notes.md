# Release Notes 2.4

*Last updated 30th May 2018.*

MAAS 2.4.0 is the current stable release. See [What's new in 2.4][whatsnew] for
a high level overview of its features and [below][currentrelease] for a more
comprehensive review of the changes this release contains.

[Historical release notes][historical-release-notes] are available for older
stable versions.

## 2.4.0

### Important announcements

#### Dependency on tgt (iSCSI) has been dropped

MAAS 2.3 moved away from using iSCSI to run ephemeral environments and
deployments, adding the ability to perform the same functions with a *squashfs*
image. While this removed the requirement for *tgt*, the dependency wasn't
dropped from 2.3. As of 2.4, however, tgt has been completely removed.

#### Apache2 dependency dropped from Debian packages

MAAS 2.0 changed the web UI to port 5240 and deprecated the use of port 80.
However, so as to not break deployments when upgrading from the previous LTS
release, MAAS continued to have *apache2* as a dependency. This was purely to
provide a reverse proxy to allow users to connect via port 80.

The availability of the MAAS *snap* changes that behaviour, no longer providing
web UI access on port 80. To remain consistent with the snap, the Debian
package removes its dependency on *apache2* and drops proxy access via port 80.

#### Debian package `maas-dns` no longer needed

The Debian package, *maas-dns*, has been made a transitional package. This
package previously provided some post-installation configuration to prepare
*bind* to be managed by MAAS, but it required *maas-region-api* to be installed
first. 

To streamline the installation and make it easier for users to install MAAS
within high-availability environments, the configuration of *bind* has been
integrated into the ‘maas-region-api’ package itself. Subsequently, ‘maas-dns’
is now a dummy transitional package that can be removed.

#### NTP services provided by Chrony

In common with changes made to Ubuntu Server, *ntpd* has been replaced with
[Chrony][chrony] for the NTP protocol. MAAS will handle the upgrade process
automatically and resume NTP service operation.

### New Features & Improvements

#### MAAS Internals optimisation

Major internal surgery to MAAS 2.4 has improved various areas not visible to
the user. These updates advance the overall performance of MAAS in larger
environments and include:

**Backend improvements**

- The image download process has been improved to ensure rack controllers
  start to download images immediately after the region controller has
  finished downloading images.
- The service monitor interval has been reduced to 30 seconds. The monitor
  tracks the status of the various services provided alongside MAAS (DNS,
  NTP, Proxy).

**AsyncIO based event loop**

- MAAS has an event loop which performs various internal actions. In older
  versions of MAAS, the event loop was managed by the default
  *Twisted* loop. MAAS now uses an AsyncIO based event loop,
  driven by uvloop, which is targeted at improving internal performance.

**Improved daemon management**

- MAAS has changed the way daemons are run to allow users to see both
  *regiond* and *rackd* as processes in the process list.
- As part of these changes, regiond workers are now managed by a master
  regiond process. In older versions of MAAS, each worker was directly run
  by systemd. The master process is now in charge of ensuring workers are running
  at all times, re-spawning new workers in case of failures. This also allows
  users to see the worker hierarchy in the process list.

**Ability to increase the number of regiond workers**

- Following the improved way MAAS daemons are run, further internal changes
  have been made to allow the number of regiond workers to be increased
  automatically. This allows MAAS to scale to handle an increased number of
  internal operations in larger environments.

**Database query optimisation**

Internal improvements have been made to reduce the footprint and number of
database queries. Some areas that have been addressed in this release include:

- When saving node objects (e.g. making any update of a machine, device,
  rack controller, etc), MAAS validated changes across various fields. This
  required an increased number of queries for fields, even when they were not
  being updated. MAAS now tracks specific fields that change and only performs
  queries for those fields. For example, to update a power state, MAAS would
  perform 11 queries. After these improvements, only 1 query is now performed.
- On every transaction, MAAS performed 2 queries to update the timestamp.
  This has now been consolidated into a single query per transaction.
- Further reductions in the number of database queries have been made,
  significantly cutting the queries made by the boot source cache image
  import process from over 100 to just under 5.  These changes greatly improve
  MAAS performance and database utilisation in larger environments. More
  improvements will continue to be made as we continue to examine various areas
  in MAAS.

**UI optimisation**

MAAS has been optimised to reduce the amount of data loaded in the WebSocket
API to render the UI. This is targeted at only processing data for viewable
information, improving various legacy areas. The work done in this area
includes:

- Various web UI performance improvements include better filtering of node types
  for machines, pods and zones.
- Script results are only loaded for viewable nodes in the machine listing page,
  reducing the overall amount of data loaded.
- The node object is updated in the WebSocket only when something has changed
  in the database, reducing the data transferred to the clients as well as the
  amount of internal queries.
- Only load historic script results (e.g. old commissioning/testing results) when
  requested / accessed by the user, instead of always making them available over
  the websocket.
- Only load node objects in listing pages when the specific object type is
  requested. For instance, only load machines when accessing the machines tab
  instead of also loading devices and controllers.
- Change the UI mechanism to only request OS details only on initial page
  load rather than every 10 seconds.

#### KVM pod improvements

KVM pods were initially created to help developers quickly iterate and test new
functionality while developing MAAS. But KVM pods have also become an essential
tool for administrators, allowing them to make better use of resources across
the datacenter. As KVM pods were initially targeted at developers, MAAS lacked
features more useful for administrators. MAAS 2.4 rectifies these shortcomings
with the following improvements:

**Pod AZs**

- The physical zone for a pod can now be defined. This helps administrators by
  conceptually placing KVM pods in an AZ, enabling them to request/allocate machines on
  demand based on its AZ. All VMs created from a pod will inherit the AZ.

**Pod tagging**

- MAAS now adds the ability to set tags for a pod. This allows administrators to use tags
  to allow/prevent the creation of a VM inside the pod using tags. For example, if the
  administrator would like a machine with a ‘tag’ named ‘virtual’, MAAS will filter all
  physical machines and only consider other VMs or a KVM pod for machine allocation.

**Added over-commit ratios for CPU and memory.**

- When composing or allocating machines, previous versions of MAAS allow the
  user to request resources regardless of resource availability. This caused
  problems when dynamically allocating machines as it allowed users to create
  an infinite number of machines when the physical host was over committed.
  This new feature allows administrators to control the amount of resources
  they want to over commit.

**Added filter for which pods or pod types to avoid when allocating machines,**

- Provides users with the ability to select which pods, or pod types, *not* to
  allocate resources from. This makes it particularly useful when dynamically
  allocating machines when MAAS has a large number of pods.

**Define a default storage pool**

- This feature allows users to select the default storage pool to use when
  composing machines, in case multiple pools have been defined. Otherwise, MAAS
  will pick the storage pool automatically, depending which pool has the most
  available space.

**Allow machines to be allocated with different storage pools**

- From the API, you can now request a machine with multiple storage devices from
  different storage pools. This feature uses storage tags to automatically map a
  storage pool in *libvirt* with a storage tag in MAAS.

See the [Pods documentation][pods-docs] for further details.

#### NTP services now provided by Chrony

In common with changes made to Ubuntu Server, *ntpd* has been replaced with
Chrony for the NTP protocol. MAAS will handle the upgrade process automatically
and resume NTP service operation.

- MAAS will configure chrony as peers on all Region Controllers
- MAAS will configure chrony as a client of peers for all Rack Controllers
- Machines will use the Rack Controllers as they do today

#### Machine locking

MAAS adds the ability to lock machines, preventing the user from performing
actions that could change their state. This gives MAAS a prevention mechanism
for potentially catastrophic actions. For example, it prevents powering off
machines by mistake, or releasing machines that could bring workloads down.

#### Audit logging

With the introduction of audit logging, MAAS 2.4 allows the administrators to
audit the user’s actions.

The audit logs are available to administrators via the MAAS CLI/API, giving
administrators a centralised location to access these logs.

See [Audit Event Logs][audit-logging] for further details.

#### Commissioning Harness

**Support for firmware upgrades and hardware specific scripts**

The *commissioning harness* has been expanded with various improvements to help
administrators write their own firmware upgrades and hardware specific scripts.
These improvements addresses some of the challenges administrators face when
performing such tasks at scale. 

Improvements include:

- auto-select all firmware upgrade/storage hardware changes (API
  only, UI will be available soon)
- write and run scripts for specific hardware
- reboot machines from the commissioning environment without disrupting the commissioning process

These improvements allow administrators to:

- target specific hardware specific by specifying PCI ID, modalias, vendor or
  model of the machine or device
- use script metadata to create firmware upgrade scripts that require a reboot
  before the machine finishes the commissioning process
- define where a script can obtain proprietary firmware and/or proprietary
  tools to perform any operations required.

See [Commissioning and Hardware Testing Scripts][hardware-scripts] for more details.

#### UI improvements

**DNS UI improvements**

MAAS 2.0 introduced the ability to manage DNS and to create resources records
such as A, AAA and CNAME. However, as the UI only supported adding and removing
domains, most of this functionality was only available via the API.

This release adds the ability to manage not only DNS domains but also
the following resource records within the web UI:

- Edit domains (e.g. TTL, name, authoritative).
- Create and delete resource records (A, AAA, CNAME, TXT, etc).
- Edit resource records.

**YUI finally dropped in favour of AngularJS**

- MAAS has now fully dropped the use of [YUI][yui] for the web UI. The final
  sections using this were the Settings and login pages. Both have now been
  transitioned to use AngularJS instead.

**Vanilla framework upgrade**

We would like to thank the Ubuntu web team for their continued hard work
upgrading MAAS to the latest version of the Vanilla framework. MAAS is looking
better and more consistent every day!

**Navigation UI improvements**

Top-level navigation has now changed to:

- *Zones* renamed to *AZs* (Availability Zones).
- *Machines*, *Devices* and *Controllers* have been moved from *Hardware* to
  the top-level menu.

**Settings page reorganisation**

- The web UI MAAS setting pages have been reorganised into tabs, making
  configuration options easier to find.

#### Other improvements

Other notable improvements in MAAS 2.4 include:

**IPMI machines boot type can now be forced**

Hardware manufactures have been upgrading their BMC firmware versions to be
more compliant with the Intel IPMI 2.0 spec. Unfortunately, the IPMI 2.0 spec
has made changes that provide a non-backward compatible user experience. For
example, if the administrator configures their machine to always PXE boot over
EFI, and the user executes an IPMI command without specifying the boot type,
the machine would use the value of the configured BIOS. However, with these new
changes, the user is required to always specify a boot type, avoiding a
fallback to the BIOS. 

As such, MAAS now allows the selection of a boot type (auto, legacy, EFI) to
force the machine to always PXE-boot with the desired type (on the next boot only) .

**API to Skip BMC configuration on commissioning**

The API now provides an option to skip BMC auto-configuration during
commissioning for IPMI systems. This option helps admins keep the credentials
provided over the API when adding new nodes.

**Gather information about BIOS & firmware**

MAAS now probes for more underlying system details, including the model, serial
number, BIOS and firmware of a machine (where available). It also gathers
details on storage devices and network interfaces.

**API for default DNS domain selection**

A default DNS domain can now be defined from the API.
