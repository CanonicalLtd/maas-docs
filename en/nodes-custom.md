# Custom node setup (preseed)

During node [enlistment][node-enlistment], [deployment][node-deployment],
[commissioning][node-commission] and node installation, MAAS sends
[Tempita-derived][tempita] configuration files to the [cloud-init][cloud-init]
process running on the target node. MAAS refers to this process as **preseed**.

These *preseed* files are used to configure a node's ephemeral and
installation environments and can be modified or augmented to perform your own
custom node configuration.


## Templates

The [Tempita][tempita] template files are found within the
`/etc/maas/preseeds/` directory on the region controller. Each template uses a
filename prefix that corresponds to a particular *phase* of MAAS node
deployment:

|     Phase     |        Filename prefix               |
|:-------------:|:------------------------------------:|
| 1. Enlistment    | enlist                            |
| 2. Commissioning | commissioning                     |
| 3. Installation  | curtin ([Curtin][curtin])         |


Additionally, the template for each phase typically consist of two files. The
first is a higher-level file that often contains little more than a URL or a
link to further credentials while a second file contains the logic to be
executed. 

The `enlist` template, for example, contains only minimal variables whereas the
contents of `enlist_userdata` includes both user variables and initialisation
logic.

!!! Note:
    Tempita’s inheritance mechanism is the reverse of what might be expected.
    Inherited files, such as `enlist_userdata`, become the new template which
    can then reference variables from the higher level file, such as `enlist`.


## Template naming

Templates are interpreted in order of their file name, allowing for base
configuration options and parameters to be overridden on an operating system,
architecture, sub-architecture, release and node name basis.

To maintain backward compatibility with earlier versions of MAAS that only
support Ubuntu, if the node operating system is Ubuntu then file names
without `{os}` will also be tried.

Consequently, template files are interpreted in the following order:

1. `{prefix}_{os}_{node_arch}_{node_subarch}_{release}_{node_name}`
or `{prefix}_{node_arch}_{node_subarch}_{release}_{node_name}`

1. `{prefix}_{os}_{node_arch}_{node_subarch}_{release}`
or `{prefix}_{node_arch}_{node_subarch}_{release}`

1. `{prefix}_{os}_{node_arch}_{node_subarch}`
or `{prefix}_{node_arch}_{node_subarch}`

1. `{prefix}_{os}_{node_arch}`
or `{prefix}_{node_arch}`

1. `{prefix}_{os}`

1. `{prefix}`

1. `generic`

The *node* needs to be the node name, as shown in the web UI URL.

The prefix can be either `enlist`, `enlist_userdata`, `commissioning`,
`curtin`, `curtin_userdata` or `preseed_master`. Alternatively, the prefix and
the following underscore can be omitted. 

For example, to create a *generic* configuration template for Ubuntu 16.04
Xenial running on a x64 architecture, the file would need to be called
`ubuntu_amd64_generic_xenial_node`.

To create the equivalent template for *curtin_userdata*, the file would be called
`curtin_userdata_ubuntu_amd64_generic_xenial_node`.

!!! Note:
    Any file targetting a specific node will replace the values and
    configuration held within any generic files. If those values are needed,
    the generic template values will need to be copied into your new file. 

## Curtin configuration

[Curtin][curtin] is the tool responsible for installing the operating system on
the node.

You can customise the Curtin installation by either editing the existing
`curtin_userdata` template or by adding a custom file as described above.

Curtin provides hooks to execute custom code before and after installation
takes place. These hooks are named `early` and `late` respectively, and they
can both be overridden to execute the Curtin configuration in the ephemeral
environment. Additionally, the `late` hook can be used to execute a
configuration for a machine being installed, a state known as *in-target*.

The following is an example of an *early* command that will run before the
installation takes place in the ephemeral environment. The command pings an
external machine to signal that the installation is about to start:

```bash
early_commands:
  signal: [wget, '--no-proxy', 'http://example.com/', '--post-data', 'system_id=&signal=starting_install', '-O', '/dev/null']
```

The following is an example of two late commands that will run after the
installation has been performed. Both run *in-target*, on the machine being
installed.

The first command adds a PPA to the machine. The second command creates a file
containing the node’s system ID:

```bash
late_commands:
  add_repo: ["curtin", "in-target", "--", "add-apt-repository", "-y", "ppa:my/ppa"]
  custom: curtin in-target -- sh -c "/bin/echo -en 'Installed ' > /tmp/maas_system_id"
```
