Title: Device Discovery | MAAS


# Device Discovery

MAAS constantly listens to the network and reports any discovered devices.
Devices are identified when the rack controller observes them communicating on
an attached IPv4 subnet. Discovered devices that do not correspond to machines
and devices already known to MAAS are shown on the
[Dashboard](installconfig-gui.md#maas-dashboard). If a device advertises a
hostname using `mDNS` (such as with `avahi` or `Bonjour`), MAAS will also
present the discovered hostname in the Dashboard. Using the Dashboard, an
unknown discovered device can be added to MAAS as a device or as a network
interface belonging to a machine or device.
