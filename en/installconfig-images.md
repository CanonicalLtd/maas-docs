# Images

MAAS supports the images it generates for stable Ubuntu releases and for CentOS
6.6 and CentOS 7. [Ubuntu Advantage][ubuntu-advantage] is needed in order to
use Windows and RHEL images or in order to build a custom image for any
operating system.

Images are stored in the region controller's database, from where the rack
controller will automatically pull them onto its local disk. 

See [CLI Image Management][cli-images] for information on advanced image
management.


## Boot sources

The place from where a region controller downloads its images is known as a
*boot source*. The main characteristics of a boot source are its location
(URL) and its associated GPG public keyring.

!!! Note:
    A *boot resource* is another name for an image. So boot resources are
    found within a boot source.

MAAS comes configured with a boot source that should suffice for most users:

[`https://images.maas.io/ephemeral-v3/daily/`][default-boot-source]

The above URL points to the 'daily' stream (for the v3 format). See
[Local image mirror][mirror] for some explanation regarding the availability of
other streams.

Although the backend supports multiple boot sources, MAAS itself uses a single
source. If multiple sources are detected the web UI will print a warning and
will be unable to manage images.


## Select and import

MAAS is only useful once it has images available to provision its nodes with.
Therefore, one key task once MAAS is installed is to select and import images
from the boot source. Once images have been imported MAAS will update them on
an hourly basis (a sync mechanism is enabled by default).

See [Select and Import Images][images-import] to get started with images.
