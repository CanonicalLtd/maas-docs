Title: Select and Import Images | MAAS 
TODO:  Be consistent with final version of installconfig-nodes-ubuntu-kernels.md (see TODO)
       There is rumor of changing the image sync frequency. 1 hr is deemed too frequent


# Select and Import Images

This page explains how to use the web UI to select and import the images that
MAAS requires in order to provision its nodes.

Note that the MAAS CLI can also be used for image management: see
[Select images][cli-select-images] and 
[Import newly-selected images][cli-import-newly-selected-images].

By default, the most recent Ubuntu LTS release (and amd64 architecture) are
selected. To change the selections go to the Images tab, select any other
images (by choosing 'Release' and 'Architecture'), and click the 'Import
images' button.

After the import process has started, imported images will be listed beneath
the selection area, alongside details on the image size, last update date and
the number of nodes used by an image. A busy indicator will also appear until
the import process has completed.

To remove an image, simply deselect it and click 'Apply Changes'.

!!! Note:
    Image sync occurs hourly and the availability of new images is
    influenced by the image stream MAAS is configured to use. See
    [Boot image sources][images-boot-image-sources].


## Other images

It is also possible to import and provision images other than Ubuntu. Images
supported and provided by MAAS will appear beneath the 'Other Images' section
of the web UI. Currently, images for both CentOS 6.6 and CentOS 7.0 are
available and these can be imported and used just like the Ubuntu images above.

## Using a local mirror

Optionally, a local mirror can be set up as the boot source. MAAS will then use
it instead of the standard internet-based server. This will reduce the time
required to complete the image import step significantly. See
[Local image mirror][mirror] for instructions on doing this.
