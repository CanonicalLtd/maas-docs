Title: Explore MAAS
table_of_contents: True

# Explore MAAS

MAAS is designed to scale. But it can be explored effectively with virtual
machines, rather than real hardware, enabling you to experiment with its
functions and processes without committing real network and hardware resources.

The following overview covers a typical virtual machine installation, with a
focus on the web-based user-interface. It's a non-exhaustive introduction, but
does provide a typical working outline of how MAAS is used and what it's
capable of. The same and more advanced configuration can be accomplished from
both the [CLI][manage-cli] and the [REST API][rest-api]. 

The [User Manual][installation] offers a more comprehensive guide to
installation, configuration and usage.

## Installation

For best results, we'd recommend testing MAAS with [libvirt][libvirt] and its
KVM/QEMU hypervisor driver. This combination is used by default in Ubuntu and
the majority of Linux distributions; it's also [easy to install][libvirt-install]
and natively supported by MAAS for power management duties.

We'd also recommend installing the GUI `virt-manager` to ease configuration,
but *libvirt* can also be operated from the command line.

!!! Note:
    MAAS will also work within a Linux virtual machine running from Oracle's
    [VirtualBox][virtualbox], which may be useful if you want to test MAAS from
    a Microsoft Windows or macOS environment. 

Assuming a base installation of [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS(Xenial) server][xenial-link]
running on a fresh *libvirt* instance or real hardware, matching the 
[minimum requirements][requirements], MAAS is installed with the following
command:

```bash
sudo snap install --devmode --stable maas
```

While testing, both the *region controller* and the *rack controller* will run
on this single machine, but you can have multiples of both to scale out MAAS to
meet your requirements, from just a few machines to hundreds across different
zones.

To initialise MAAS for a single machine, issue the following command:

```bash
sudo maas init --mode all
```

After entering a username and password, web UI is now accessible from the
configured address from where you can now login with your new credentials.

See [Installation][installation] for further details.

### Welcome to MAAS

After a fresh MAAS installation, the web UI presents a
[Welcome dashboard][welcome-page] to help set many system-wide options,
including connectivity, image downloads, and authentication keys.

table th, table td {
    background: #f7f7f7;
    border: 0px solid;
    padding: 15px 10px;
}

table.logos {
    background: #f7f7f7;
    border: 0px solid;
    padding: 4px 4px;
}

table.logos th, table.logos td{
    align="center";
    valign="center";
    border: 8px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: #ffffff;
  }
</style>

<table width="500" border-width="0px" cellpadding="5">

<tr>

<td align="center" valign="center" border-width="0px" >
<img src="../media/intro-explore__2.4_welcome1.png" alt="First page of Welcome settings" />
<br />
<i>Welcome</i> sets global values...
</td>

<td align="center" valign="center" border-width="0px">
<img src="../media/intro-explore__2.4_welcome2.png" alt="Second page of Welcome settings" />
<br />
...before the MAAS <i>Dashboard</i>
</td>

</tr>

</table>

With this complete, you'll see *MAAS has been successfully set up*. Click 'Go
to the Dashboard' to proceed (although you may need to wait a few moments for
your selected images to sync locally).


## Networking

The *Dashboard* landing page, manually opened with a click of the MAAS logo,
lists non-registered devices detected automatically on the network.  This
[network discovery][device-disco] enables you to easily add or map devices
already connected to your network that you may not necessarily want managed by
MAAS.

![network discovery][img__disco]

Note:
    Network discovery can be disabled at any time from the button on the
    *Dashboard* view.

### Spaces, fabrics, zones and subnets

![MAAS network concepts][img__netconcepts]

To accommodate rack installation within complex network topologies and the
requirements of flexible machine deployment, MAAS offers comprehensive control
over networking.

Alongside the management of its own domain, configured via the DNS page of the
web UI, MAAS can isolate machine deployment across spaces, zones, fabrics and
subnets.

![MAAS subnet configuration][img__subnets]

Network settings are spread across several web UI configuration pages. The
*Zones* page, for example, enables you to see how many machines, devices and
controllers are using a zone as well as making it easy to add a zone. The
*Subnets* page provides access to fabric, VLAN, subnet and spaces
configuration.


## Deploy hardware

MAAS-managed machines are listed, and operated on, from the
[Nodes][node-overview] page, making this page one of the most important in the
MAAS web UI.

If you're testing MAAS using virtual machines, creating a new instance and
booting it on the same network will be enough for it to appear here. This is
because new machines are added automatically when they first connect to your
network.  Alternatively, the 'Add hardware' menu lets you add machines via
their MAC address manually.

After power and interfaces are configured, machines need to be commissioned to
retrieve CPU, memory and storage information. From this point, they can be
acquired, tested, deployed and released as fully fledged members of your MAAS
cloud.

![Node filter and deployment][img__deploy]

A powerful filtering mechanism on the left, based around [tags][tags] and hardware
characteristics, is used to list only those machines you're interested in, from
where one or more can be selected and operated on.


### Images

When it comes to running applications, MAAS can deploy any supported variant of
Ubuntu, including LTS and non-LTS versions for x86, ARM, PPC and s390x systems.
Both CentOS 7 and CentOS 6 can also be deployed to your machines, as can
Windows and RHEL images with [Ubuntu Advantage][ubuntu-advantage].

![Image import overview][img__images]


### Pods

Even greater control over your hardware comes from the use of *pods* to group
either virtual machines (using libvirt and KVM) or physical systems with Intel
RSD into an *abstraction of resources*. This allows for
[composable hardware][composable], where machine requests can be made without
having a specific machine pre-built.

To add a pod of virtual machines, click the 'Add pod' button on the *Pods* page
of the web UI, give the pod a name and select *Virsh* as the pod type, entering
the address for the libvirt controlled pool below. 

See [KVM guest nodes][kvm-nodes] for further details on on adding *libvirt*
virtual machines to MAAS.

After a pod has been created, hardware can be *composed* by selecting the pod
and selecting 'Compose' from the action menu. From the pane that appears, you
can select exactly how you'd like your composed hardware to be configured,
including the number of cores, CPU speed, RAM and combined storage. Click
'Compose machine' and MAAS will combine resources to create a new single
entity that can be used just like any other machine.
