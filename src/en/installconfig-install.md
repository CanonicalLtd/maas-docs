# Installation

There are three main ways to install MAAS:

- [From an Ubuntu Server ISO](installconfig-server-iso.html) 
    - Recommended for new MAAS environments
    - Enables you to get started as quickly as possible 
    - Configures a server as either a rack or a region controller

- [From a package repository](installconfig-package-install.html) 
    - Adds MAAS to a pre-existing Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installation
    - Can install both a rack and a region controller on a single machine
    - Ideal for beta and developmental versions of MAAS

- [Locally with LXD](installconfig-lxd-install.html)
    - Creates a self-contained local MAAS environment within a container
    - Runs the region controller, the rack controller and multiple nodes
    - Ideal for testing and experimenting with MAAS

If you're new to MAAS, we'd recommend installing from an [Ubuntu Server
ISO](installconfig-server-iso.html).
